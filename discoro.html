<p>
  asyncoro is a Python framework for developing concurrent,
  distributed programs with asynchronous completions and
  coroutines. See <a href="index.html">API for Coroutines</a> for more
  details.
</p>

<h4>API for Distributed Coroutines</h4>

<p>By default, asyncoro does not start network services so that only
  coroutines running in that asyncoro instance can communicate;
  see <a href="index.html">API for Coroutines</a> for
  details. However, when network services are enabled, messages can
  also be exchanged among coroutines running on multiple asyncoro
  instances over network. Following additional API describe network
  features of asyncoro for distributed programming.
</p>

<p><b>AsynCoro(node=None, udp_port=None, tcp_port=0, ext_ip_addr=None,
      name=None, secret='', certfile=None, keyfile=None,
      notifier=None)</b> enables network services when
      either <em>node</em> or <em>udp_port</em> options is given.
    <em>node</em> is either host name or IP address
    and <em>udp_port</em> is port number where asyncoro starts network
    services. If <em>udp_port</em> is set to 0, then port 51350 is
    used. Thus, initializing AsynCoro with <em>AsynCoro(udp_port=0)</em>
    is simplest way to start asyncoro for distributed programming.
</p>

<p>Other options to AsynCoro that may be useful in networked operations are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>By default, any available port is used for <em>tcp_port</em>
    where asyncoros exchange messages. However, this port can be set
    to a specific number, which can be useful when dealing with
    firewall/port forwarding.</li>
  <li><em>name</em>, if given, must be a string that is unique for
    each instance of asyncoro that communicate. If this option is not
    given, it is set to string representing location where network
    services are running. Using <em>name</em>, the location where a
    specific asyncoro instance is running can be found with the
    method <em>locate_peer(name)</em>.  This location can then be used
    to find and use services, such as monitoring coroutines, or start
    remotely callable coroutines.</li>
  <li><em>secret</em> is a string that must be set to same for all
    asyncoros that communicate.  It is used to compute a hash that is
    used and checked in all communication, so that only asyncoros that
    use same secret can be peers. Note that the messages are not
    encrypted; if security of messages is needed, SSL
    options <em>certfile</em> and/or <em>keyfile</em> can be
    used.</li>
  <li><em>certfile</em> and <em>keyfile</em> are as per
    <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/ssl.html">SSL module</a>.</li>
  <li><em>ext_ip_addr</em> must be IP address of gateway/firewall when
    asyncoro is used behind that gateway/firewall and other peers are
    outside that gateway/firewall. With this option, peers can
    communicate with asyncoro running on a local network and other
    peers are on remote network.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  When AsynCoro is initialized with network services for distributed
  programming, following methods are available to find and use services
  at peers.
  </p>

<ul>
  <li>The (singleton) AsynCoro instance, which can be obtained
    with <em>AsynCoro.instance()</em>, has following additional methods:
    <ul>
      <li><b>locate_peer(name, timeout=None)</b> finds and returns
	location where peer AsynCoro with <em>name</em> is running. This
	location can be used in other methods. The <em>timeout</em> is the
	maximum number (or fractions) of seconds for finding location. If
	timeout seconds elapse (if no peer with <em>name</em> is running
	or reachable), <em>None</em> is returned. This method must be used
	with <em>yield</em>.
      </li>
      <li><b>locate_coro(name, location=None, timeout=None)</b>
	finds and returns reference to coroutine registered
	with <em>name</em>. If <em>location</em> is given (e.g., obtained
	by <em>locate_peer</em>), only the peer running at that location
	is queried; otherwise, all peers are queried. If coro is
	successfully located, the return value is an instance of
	_RemoteCoro (see below). This method must be used
	with <em>yield</em>.
      </li>
      <li><b>locate_channel(name, location=None, timeout=None)</b> finds
	and returns a reference (an instance of <em>_RemoteChannel</em>)
	to channel registered with <em>name</em>.  If <em>location</em> is
	given (e.g., obtained by <em>locate_peer</em>), only the peer
	running at that location is queried; otherwise, all peers are
	queried. The reference returned can be used to <em>send</em>
	or <em>deliver</em> messages, just as if it is an AsyncChannel
	(although AsyncChannel is at remote peer). This method must be
	used with <em>yield</em>.
      </li>
      <li><b>register_RCI(method)</b> registers generator
	method <em>method</em> as remotely callable. RCI stands for Remote
	Coro Invocation (or Remotely Callable Interface). Once registered,
	coroutines at peers can locate and invoke the method (i.e., run
	the method with coroutine where it is registered).
      </li>
      <li><b>locate_RCI(name, location=None, timeout=None)</b>
	finds and returns location where remotely callable method
	with <em>name</em> has been registered. This location can then be
	used for running (remote) coroutine with that method. This method
	must be used with <em>yield</em>.
      </li>
      <li><b>run_RCI(location, name, *args, **kwargs)</b> requests peer
	asyncoro at <em>location</em> to run generator method <em>name</em>
	(as a coroutine) with arguments <em>*args</em> and keyword
	arguments <em>**kwargs</em>. If coroutine is started successfully,
	the return value is a reference to that coroutine (i.e., instance
	of _RemoteCoro). This can be used to monitor and send messages. If
	security (in addition to SSL and/or 'secret' features) is needed
	so that coroutines can be remotely started with only appropriate
	credentials, the caller can be expected to execute
	<code>loc = yield locate_RCI('peer_method')
rcoro = yield run_RCI(loc, 'peer_method')
try:
    yield coro.monitor(rcoro)
    rcoro.send(creds)
    # ...
except MonitorException as exc:
    # process exception</code>
    and generator method 'peer_method' execute
    <code>creds = yield coro.receive()
if not valid_creds(creds):
    raise Exception('invalid credentials')
# ...</code>
      </li>

      <li><b>peer(node, udp_port=51350)</b> locates peer asyncoro at
	given <em>node</em> and <em>udp_port</em>. If all asyncoros
	are running on a local network, they can find each other
	automatically through UDP broadcasting. However, if an
	asyncoro is running on a remote network, it needs to be
	explicitly located with this <em>peer</em> method. It is not
	needed to run this method on both sides - if one asyncoro
	successfully runs this method, they will find each other. This
	method must be used with <em>yield</em>.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>AsyncChannel's <b>register(name=None)</b> registers it with
    AsynCoro so that coroutines at peers can locate and obtain a
    reference with <em>locate_channel</em>. If <em>name</em>
    is <em>None</em>, name of the channel initialized with is used for
    registering. The <em>name</em> must be unique, at least at the
    asyncoro where it is registered. If there are duplicate names at
    different asyncoros, finding a channel
    with <em>locate_channel</em> should be used with specific location
    (peer).  Note that instances of SyncChannel cannot be registered,
    as it has no <em>reference</em> method.
  </li>
  <li>Coroutine's <b>register(name=None)</b> registers it with
    AsynCoro so that coroutines at peers can locate and obtain a
    reference with <em>locate_coro</em>. If <em>name</em> is
    <em>None</em>, the name of generator method used (i.e.,
    coro.name)is used. The <em>name</em> must be unique, at least at
    the asyncoro where it is running. If there are duplicate names at
    different asyncoros, finding a coroutine with <em>locate_coro</em>
    should be used with a specific location (peer).
  </li>
  <li><em>locate_coro</em> and <em>run_RCI</em> return an instance of
    _RemoteCoro on success.  This instance can be used to monitor and
    send messages, as if it is running locally, as shown in snippet
    for <em>run_RCI</em>.
  </li>
